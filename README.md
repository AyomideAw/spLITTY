## 📋 What It Does

spLITTY is a smart bill splitter for friend groups that lets users:
- Upload a receipt or type in expenses
- AI parses and splits the total fairly
- Log those expenses on-chain using Move smart contracts
- Settle balances directly on Aptos — no third-party app, no trust needed

It’s like Splitwise — but on-chain and walletless.

## ⚙️ How It Works with the Blockchain

### ✅ Onboarding
- We use **Aptos zkLogin SDK** to generate a wallet tied to a Google account (no seed phrase).
- The wallet address is stored in Firestore and displayed in the UI.

### ✅ Logging Expenses
- On clicking “Save Summary,” each item is submitted via `log_expense()` to the deployed **Move smart contract**.
- The contract records who paid and how much into an on-chain `Group` resource.

### ✅ Settling Payments
- The `SettlePage` lets users input a wallet address and amount.
- This triggers the `settle()` function to update balances **directly on-chain**.

### ✅ Viewable on Aptos Explorer
Every action — `log_expense`, `settle` — is a real transaction on the **Aptos Testnet**.
